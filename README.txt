This project is a Sample Search Engine I developed for a project in my Infromatics class as part of my coursework back in college. It was developed to understand how a search engine may function, and was developed frontend to backend. I used C#, SQL, Amazon AWS, Azure, and Visual Studio to develop this.

The code in here shows my first foray into C#, and I was thrown into the fire on the project - going completely blind and having little guidance on how it's supposed to be - so forgive it for some untidiness. However, I still think it is useful, and I leave this here for anyone who is curious about how SQL search engines could work.
